        - The <h1> tag defines a large heading
        - The <p> tag defines a paragraph
        - Tags appear as an opening <div> and closing </div> pair

            <p> <!-- This is a paragraph, it's the main way to display text on a web page -->
                The following chart related GDP and life expectancy for countries coloured by their continent.
                We see a positive relation which speaks about how the richer the country, the healthier it is, all in averages.
                Nevertheless, continent clusters shows us that such positive relation is spread and less linear for African countries, where income is not as related to health as in other countries. 
                One explanation, or hidden mediator, could be income inequality.
